Hello! Here is my current Excel sheet, which holds the data collected from my Circuit Playground Express. Inside, you will find data that has been captured, graphed, and analyzed using different colored filters. The purpose of this exercise is to test the effect of various colored filters on light intensity readings. By using the CPX, I tracked how much light passes through each filter over time. This helps demonstrate how different colors absorb or transmit light uniquely. The data is logged and visualized to identify patterns, compare filter performance, and better understand how light behaves under different conditions. These insights can also inform practical applications, such as designing energy-efficient lighting or optimizing color filtering in sensors.
